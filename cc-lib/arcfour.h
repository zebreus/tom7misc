/* Alleged RC4 algorithm.
   The RC4 name is trademarked by RSA DSI.
   This implementation is based on the algorithm
   published in Applied Cryptography.

   This algorithm is adorably simple, but
   should only be used for cryptography with
   significant care. Note also that like many
   pseudorandom number generators, there are
   some small biases in its output statistics.
